<html><h1>Lesson 3: What even are loops?</h1>
<br>
<p>K, everyone count to 10</p>
<p>K, everyone count backwards from 10 to 0</p>

<h3>Any questions?</h3>

<p>Hopefully there is enough space so that y'all don't immediately see this</p>
<p>Anyway, we are going to introduce loops</p>
<p>They are exactly what they sound like. They loop from one value to another until they finish or crash</p>
<br>

<h3>The while loop</h3>

<br>
<p>Ignore the stuff below 'till I demo on the board</p>
<br>
<p>ctr = 10</p>
<p>while (ctr &gt; 0):</p>
<p>&emsp;print(ctr)</p>
<p>&emsp;ctr--</p>
<br>

<h3>The for loop</h3>

<br>
<p>Again ignore the stuff below 'till I demo on the board</p>
<br>
<p>for i in range(10):</p>
<p>&emsp;print(i)</p>
<br>

<h3>When to use each one</h3>

<br>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

	<tr>

		<th>For</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User input</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Don't know how many times loop will iterate, but know the endpoint</td>
		<td>Know how many times the loop will iterate, but not the endpoint</td>

<h3>I shall now take questions and comments and whatever</h3>

<p>If we have time remaining, we could start with lesson 4</p>
