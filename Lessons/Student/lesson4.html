<p>Rosalind is a website that we will be using to hone our computer science skills</p>
<p>It's under the "Links" button on the StuyCCC site</p>
<br>
<p>Today we're going to do our very first "unguided" problem</p>
<p>I'm stealing this problem from Rosalind, hence the title of this lesson. But we will go more into Rosalind later</p>
<br>
<p>Write code that, given a DNA string, counts the nucleotides</p>
<br>
<p>For example, if my code had</p>
<p>&emsp;countNucleotides(x)</p>
<p>and dna = "ATCGATCGAATTCCGG"</p>
<br>
<p>I could write countNucleotides(dna) and it would return</p>
<p>A: 4</p>
<p>T: 4</p>
<p>C: 4</p>
<p>G: 4</p>
