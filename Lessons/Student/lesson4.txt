Lesson 4: What even is Rosalind?
Rosalind is a website that we will be using to hone our computer science skills
It's under the "Links" button on the StuyCCC site

Today we're going to do our very first "unguided" problem

Write code that, given a DNA string, counts the nucleotides

For example, if my code had
	countNucleotides(x)
and dna = "ATCGATCGAATTCCGG"

I could write countNucleotides(dna) and it would return
A: 4
T: 4
C: 4
G: 4

When we're done, we can review anything y'all are confused about
