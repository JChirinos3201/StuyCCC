<p>I trust that we all know the typical Fibnacci sequence</p>
<p>&emsp;1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 35, ...</p>
<br>
<p>The rule is given the first 2 numbers, every number is defined as the sum of the two that come before it</p>
<p>That means we can have</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6, 9, 15, 24, 39, ...</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are we doing today?</p>
<p>We have 3 tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Define reg_fib(n),  a function that returns a list containing the fibonacci sequence of size n when the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define fib(l, n), which is reg_fib but you're given a list, l, of size 2 containing the first 2 number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define print_fib(l, n), which is the same as fib(l, n) but you're printing each number on a new line rather than returning the list. Make it better than fib(l, n)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you finish, you're pretty cool. We'll go over it and I'll post code below when we're done</p>
