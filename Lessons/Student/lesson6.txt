Lesson 6: What even are Fibonacci sequences?
I trust that we all know the typical Fibnacci sequence
	1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 35, ...

The rule is given the first 2 numbers, every number is defined as the sum of the two that come before it
That means we can have
!!ulist!!
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...
4, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, ...
6, 9, 15, 24, 39, ...
!!endulist!!

So what are we doing today?
We have 3 tasks:
!!olist!!
Define reg_fib(n),  a function that returns a list containing the fibonacci sequence of size n when the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1
Define fib(l, n), which is reg_fib but you're given a list, l, of size 2 containing the first 2 number
Define print_fib(l, n), which is the same as fib(l, n) but you're printing each number on a new line rather than returning the list. Make it better than fib(l, n)
!!endolist!!
If you finish, you're pretty cool. We'll go over it and I'll post code below when we're done
