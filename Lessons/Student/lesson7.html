<p>Let's solidify our knowledge on Python syntax so we can solve cool problems with syntactic accuracy (and with aesthetic)!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>A comment begins with a hash character (#). They are useful for increasing the readability of your code so that you can reference them later.</p>
<p>There are NO multi-lines or block comments in Python</p>
<br>
<h3>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h3>
<p>You can write two separate statements into a single line using the semicolon (;)</p>

<br>
<h3> Indentation (VERY VERY IMPORTANT) </h3>
<p>Python uses whitespace (spaces and tabs) to define program blocks whereas other languages like C, C++ use braces ({}) to indicate blocks of codes for class, functions or flow control.</p>
<p>The number of whitespaces (spaces and tabs) in the indentation is not fixed, but all statements within the block must be the indented same amount.</p>
<p>Convention is 4 spaces per indentation and NO tabs</p>

<br>
<h3>Reserved Python Words</h3>
<p>The following identifiers are used as reserved words of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.</p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>class</td>
      <td>finally</td>
      <td>is</td>
      <td>return</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>None</td>
      <td>continue</td>
      <td>for</td>
      <td>lambda</td>
      <td>try</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>def</td>
      <td>from</td>
      <td>nonlocal</td>
      <td>while</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>and</td>
      <td>del</td>
      <td>global</td>
      <td>not</td>
      <td>with</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>as</td>
      <td>el</td>
      <td>if</td>
      <td>or</td>
      <td>yield</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>assert</td>
      <td>else</td>
      <td>import</td>
      <td>pass</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>break</td>
      <td>except</td>
      <td>in</td>
      <td>raise</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

<ul>
<li>
<p>0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4, 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6, 9, 15, 24, 39, ...</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are we doing today?</p>
<p>We have 3 tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Define reg_fib(n),  a function that returns a list containing the fibonacci sequence of size n when the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define fib(l, n), which is reg_fib but you're given a list, l, of size 2 containing the first 2 number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define print_fib(l, n), which is the same as fib(l, n) but you're printing each number on a new line rather than returning the list. Make it better than fib(l, n)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you finish, you're pretty cool. We'll go over it and I'll post code below when we're done</p>
