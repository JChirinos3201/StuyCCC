# Lesson 0: What even is this club?

First, we shall all introduce ourselves.

## Let's talk business!

- We have a Facebook page!
- Please reply to emails!
- We also have a [website](https://joanchirinos.github.io/StuyCCC/)!

## What shall y'all be learning in this club?

- How to Python
- How to CS
- How to _think_ in CS
- How to apply your CS knowledge to CS Competitions

Though learning Python is ~~probably~~ definitely easier than learning C, it will still take a decent amount of work and commitment!

#### I'll take any questions or comments y'all have now
