# Lesson 1: What is Python and how do we use it?

## Exercises

1. What is 21 raised to the 14th power?
2. Write a function with the header `add_four(a, b, c, d)` that adds the 4 arguments together and returns the result. You're allowed to define **ONE** other function (a helper function), and you can only use **ONE** plus sign (`+`) in total.
3. Given the function header `def sleep_in(is_weekday, is_vacation)`:
  1. `is_weekday` is true if it's a weekday
  2. `is_vacation` is true if we're on vacation
  3. We sleep in if it's not a weekday, or if we're on vacation
  4. Return `True` if we sleep in
4. Given the function header `sum_double(a, b)`
  1. If the arguments are different, return their sum
  2. If the arguments are the same, return **double** their sum
