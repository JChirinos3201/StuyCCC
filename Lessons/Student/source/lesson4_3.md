Write code that, given a DNA string, counts the nucleotides (A, C, T, and G).

For example, if my code had
	countNucleotides(x)
and dna = "ATCGATCGAATTCCGG"

I could write countNucleotides(dna) and it would return
A: 4
T: 4
C: 4
G: 4


When you're done, let us know and we will review as a group! Also let us know if you have any questions.  This is an individual exercise, so try your best to do this without the help of the teachers.  If you really need to, you can review past lessons.
