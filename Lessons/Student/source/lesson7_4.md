# Lesson 7: What are regular expressions?

## What are regular expressions?

Like y'all may have guessed from the title, we're going to use these nifty tools called _regular expressions_

These are present in a lot of different languages and tools (like Python, Google Forms, etc.)

I'm not gonna tell y'all what they are straight off the bat. Instead, I'll let give you an example and let you figure it out.

---

Let's have a Python regular expression: ```"abc"```

This parses the string ```"my three favorite letters are abc but i hate lmn"```

and it finds ```["abc"]```

---

Let's have another example

This time, our regular expression is: ```"\w"```

This parses the string ```"hhsh455 nks9"```

and it finds ```['h', 'h', 's', 'h', '4', '5', '5', 'n', 'k', 's', '9']```

If we parse the same string using the regular expression: ```"\w+"```

it finds ```['hhsh455', 'nks9']```

I'll give y'all some time to talk with the people around you, then we'll get into what regular expressions are
