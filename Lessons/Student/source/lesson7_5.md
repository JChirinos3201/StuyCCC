# Lesson 7: What are regular expressions?

## What are regular expressions? (cont.)

Let's define regular expressions:

A **regular expression** is a **special text string for describing a search pattern**.

You use these when you want to search for something in a string, but the values can be variable.

If you wanted to search for instances of "abc", you could use str.find() in Python

But if you wanted to search for instances of 3 alphanumeric characters followed by a space and then either a newline or a space, it gets a little harder
