<p>So the "lessons" for teachers/advanced people are going to be less structured than the student lessons.</p>
<p>&emsp;Why?</p>
<p>Because you guys already know how to CS, so I want you guys to practice a lot and discuss techniques with each other.</p>
<br>
<p>I will generally post a link to a problem set and tell you which ones to do.</p>
<p>You could work in small teams if you're not too loud.</p>
<p>You're free to do all the questions, but you kinda have to do the ones I "assign" first because those are the ones we're going to be going over and discussing.</p>
<p>Please don't cheat or whatever because: what do you gain? Saying this is cliche, but you're honestly just cheating yourself (of learnination)</p>
<br>
<p>Today we're not doing a problem set.</p>
<p>Do this (which is from student lesson 6 I think)</p>
<br>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Define reg_fib(n),  a function that returns a list containing the fibonacci sequence of size n when the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define fib(l, n), which is reg_fib but you're given a list, l, of size 2 containing the first 2 number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define print_fib(l, n), which is the same as fib(l, n) but you're printing each number on a new line rather than returning the list. Make it better than fib(l, n)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>Once you're done, call me or a VP over and we'll look it over. If it's good, you can start helping the children who need help</p>
