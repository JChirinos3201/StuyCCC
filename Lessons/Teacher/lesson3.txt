Lesson 3: PClassic

Hey y'all we're going to do PClassic stuff for a while because I like the format and the variety

I'm going to present my solution for Problem 6 and 7 of 2017 Problem set

Some of y'all have done it in different ways and that's fine. As long as your method works and it doesn't take toooooo long, it should be a valid submission.
However, there are some techniques to work faster

For PClassic, you're placed based on the number of questions you get. Additionally, if 2 teams get the same number of questions right, they take into account the number of wrong submissions.

For some other CS Competitions (like SJC) they take into account number of wrong submissions AND how long each submission takes, so you shouldn't take a long time for the simpler problems.
Try to do the first 4 problems for the PClassic sets in less than 10 minutes (if you're doing the beginner path) and the intermediate problems as quick as you can so you can put your brains together for the last couple problems.

Another tip is to split up who does which problems. Except for the last couple problems, you shouldn't have everyone working on the same problem. I'll detail split-up tips below

I know y'all are probably pretty good at CS, but just having CS gods doesn't make a great team. Most of the time, there will be a couple problems that require some more advanced mathematical thinking. If you're a CS god but aren't a math god, you should do the easier problems.
