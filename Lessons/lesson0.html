<br>
<p>In this club you will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How to write Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to CS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to think in CS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to apply CS knowledge to Competitive Programming</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Initially, we shall be spending plenty of time sans computers because it's better to understand concepts then apply them to writing code than to just jump in with code</p>
<br>
<p>Learning Python may be easier than learning C or something, but it still takes some time and commitment and, potentially, work outside of class. So if you hate learning, adios!</p>
