In this club you will learn:
!!ulist!!
How to write Python
How to CS
How to think in CS
How to apply CS knowledge to Competitive Programming
!!endulist!!

Initially, we shall be spending plenty of time sans computers because it's better to understand concepts then apply them to writing code than to just jump in with code

Learning Python may be easier than learning C or something, but it still takes some time and commitment and, potentially, work outside of class. So if you hate learning, adios!
