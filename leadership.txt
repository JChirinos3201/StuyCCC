Yo! You!
Who me? you ask.
Yeah, you! Do you want to join a super awesome club where you get to learn CS and teach CS?

Now that I caught your eye...

The Stuy Competitive Computing Club(StuyCCC) is a club with 2 main goals: to teach younglings CS and to teach oldlings about Competitive Computing.

We would meet most Tuesdays and (almost) every Friday. You SoftDev guys would be teachers who, when they're not doing CS competition practice problems, help me teach Freshmen and Sophomores CS.

This Competitive Programming learnination shall prepare you to go to CS competitions and win cool prizes (swag, money, etc.)

I am looking for 4 or 5 teachers and a VP. If you'd just like to learn about Competitive Computing and not teach:
	1. Why are you like this
	2. Deets on our StuyActivities account (with the scheduled meeting dates) shall come later, so stay tuned!
The teacher's dates are flexible (you don't have to be there EVERY day, but please do). The VP has to be there pretty much every meeting

If you're at all interested in teaching or VPing, please fill out this form: https://tinyurl.com/StuyCCCForm
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, concerns, CS memes, puns, etc., email Joan Chirinos (me) @ StuyCCC@gmail.com
