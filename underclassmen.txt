Hey folks!
My name is Joan Chirinos, and I’m the president of the Stuy Competitive Computing Club.

"What’s the Competitive Computing Club???"

Good question! As underclassmen, y'all will spend a chunk of your time learning how to write Python. We will also use this knowledge in a number of fun activities, including mini-competitions! With your immense Python knowledge, you can even go to PClassic, a larger and more structured CS competition!

If this sounds interesting to you, please fill out the form below. I will be emailing you shortly about our first meeting!
