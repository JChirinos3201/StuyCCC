Hey folks!
My name is Joan Chirinos, and I'm the president of the Stuy Competitive Computing Club.

"What's the Competitive Computing Club???"

Good question! As upperclassmen, we will teach you how to use your rad CS skills to solve the problems typically found in CS competitions. We will also use this knowledge in a number of fun activities, including mini-competitions! With your immense knowledge, you can even go to PClassic or SJC, larger and more structured CS competitions!

If this sounds interesting to you, please fill out the form below. I will be emailing you shortly about our first meeting!
